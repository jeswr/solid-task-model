/**
 * Pure IRI helpers — the ONE reviewed home for the small, total IRI predicates
 * the task / tracker / contacts modules all share.
 *
 * These were previously duplicated across `task.ts`, `tracker.ts` and
 * `contacts.ts` (an exported `isHttpIri` in `task.ts` plus a private copy in
 * `tracker.ts`; a private `docOf` in both `tracker.ts` and `contacts.ts`).
 * Consolidating them here gives the maintainer a single place to audit the
 * untrusted-input http(s)-only filter and the document-URL derivation, instead
 * of N transcribed copies that could silently diverge.
 *
 * **Pure core, no platform.** This module depends only on the WHATWG `URL`
 * global (available in both Node and the browser) — no `node:*`, no DOM, no
 * RDF/`n3` machinery — so it is client-safe and can be read as a small spec.
 */
/**
 * The **canonical** absolute http(s) IRI for `value`, else `undefined` — the
 * recurring untrusted-input filter for an OPTIONAL object-property write (drop a
 * non-http(s) value rather than coerce it into a malformed `NamedNode`). This is
 * the single canonicalization primitive; {@link isHttpIri} is defined in terms of
 * it so the boolean guard and the value filter can never disagree.
 *
 * Returns the parsed `URL.href`, NOT the raw input. This matters because WHATWG
 * `new URL()` TOLERATES (and strips) leading/trailing C0-control + space
 * characters and some tab/newline noise — so `"  https://x.org/a  "` and
 * `"https://x.org/a\n"` parse "OK" but the RAW string contains whitespace
 * illegal inside an RDF IRI. Returning `u.href` writes only the normalized,
 * well-formed IRI, so a hostile / sloppy input can never land an invalid
 * `NamedNode` with embedded whitespace on the wire.
